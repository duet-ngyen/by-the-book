    'Deep Republicanism: Prelude to Professionalism establishes the importance of
 Machiavelli\'s radical republican agenda in understanding the major revolutions of
the modern world.
Donald Hodges\'s nuanced analysis of The Discourse of Livy reveals a subversive
republicanism in Machiavelli\'s theorizing that is at odds with the demoliberalism
often perceived as the work\'s primary political agenda. Hodges follows this strand
of republicanism through history, providing a fascinating account of how these two
political philosophies vied with each other throughout much of modern history in
conflicts that culminated in the Russian and American Revolutions. A unique treatment
of Machiavelli\'s political agenda, its implementation by numerous historical actors,
 and its legacy, professionalism,Deep Republicanism examines aspects of Machiavelli\'s
 work that have often been overlooked. It also sheds light on Machiavelli himself, whose
famously devious and crafty writing style was partly motivated by his political
vulnerability in fifteenth century Florence. Hodges\'s study is both a novel
examination of the historical influence of Machiavelli\'s thought and a testament
to the enduring power, influence, and subtlety of one of the best-known Western
political philosophers.'],
    ["Mexico, the End of the Revolution", "ABC-CLIO", 2001, "9780313390531", 36.96,"http://i1.ebkimg.com/previews/000/000496/000496726/000496726-hq-168-80.jpg",
     'This study reveals how the social pact, formalized during the armed stage of the Mexican Revolution (1910-20) and implemented during the second stage (1920-40), was upset during the third or arrested stage (1940-70) when the bureaucrat-professionals at the helm opted for intensive economic development by taking the capitalist road. Although momentarily revived during yet a fourth stage of revolution (1970-82), this social pact was subsequently betrayed from within by the official party of the Revolution and undermined from without by the operation of economic forces behind the scenes. In this first book on the complete history of the Mexican Revolution, Hodges and Gandy reveal that, along with the end of its social pact, Mexico passed out of its former nationalist and capitalist orbit to enter the new professional societies and global order fathered by the transnationals.
From 1920 to 1970, Mexico\'s bureaucrat-professionals hung onto political power while native capitalists continued to flourish. In response, Mexico\'s workers and peasants staged strikes against the nationalized sector and fomented guerrilla wars. Concessions were then made to this group until, beginning in 1982, the social pact was again eroded at the expense, not only of the popular sectors, but also of the capitalists. The economic surplus was redistributed away from owners and into the pockets of professionals. That was the Revolution\'s last gasp before it was officially put to rest in 2000 with the official party\'s defeat at the polls. Hodges and Gandy challenge the current belief that Mexico\'s economic system is still capitalist by presenting statistical evidence that shows how the chief beneficiaries of the economy are no longer the providers of capital, but instead the providers of professional services.
